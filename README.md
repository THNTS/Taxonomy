Car Taxonomy 

B.G. Mirkin, D.I. Babin, D.S. Frolov

Our project builds on previous work analyzing car reviews from Russian aggregator sites.
We extract key characteristics from the data and use them to create a taxonomy.
To identify the most frequently co-used characteristics, we apply the ParGenFS algorithm proposed by D.S. Frolov to calculate clusters.
These clusters enable us to identify car models that represent them and analyze which parameters are most important from the perspective of car buyers.

My work involved preprocessing the dataset, computing feature correlations on texts and cluterization algorithm, results interpretation.
